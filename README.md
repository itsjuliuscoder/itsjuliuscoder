<h1 align='center'>Hi FriendsðŸ‘‹</h1>

âœ¨ I'm Julius a Software Engineer residing in Lagos, Nigeria. I am passionate about bending the computer to my will by turning complex problems into simple solutions.

Currently, I'm working on building fintech solutions that powers Mobile Money transactions across Africa with United Bank of Africa. I am a big fan of building digital solutions for Africa's growing population. When I'm not coding, I share my thoughts on Africa, Tech and any thing that excites me on [Medium](https://medium.com/@juliusolajumokecoder)
